<p>MoneroWallet is an AngularJS based CryptoCurrency Web Wallet for storing and sending Monero.
It uses Firebase for its backend and Google App Engine for hosting.
Firebase works by storing an encrypted seed generated by the client.
After authentication, it is retrieved and is used to rebuild the Monero Private Key.
This is used to sign transactions which are later broadcast to the Monero Network.
An Android app was also built leveraging the same back-end.
